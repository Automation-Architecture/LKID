# Agent Teams Project

## KidneyHood App

**Goal:** Lead gen web app — patients enter kidney health lab values, view an eGFR trajectory chart, download PDF. Email captured for warm campaign.
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 (Vercel) + FastAPI (Railway) + PostgreSQL (Railway) + Clerk v7 (auth) + Playwright (PDF)
**Jira:** [SPEC Board](https://automationarchitecture.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SPEC/boards/329/backlog) | [LKID Board](https://automationarchitecture.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/LKID/boards/363)
**Repo:** [github.com/Automation-Architecture/LKID](https://github.com/Automation-Architecture/LKID)
**Specs:** `/Users/brad/IDE/kidneyhood/` (3 docx files)
**Status:** Sprint 5 COMPLETE (Launch Readiness theme, 8/8 engineering cards + 1 bonus card, all shipped Apr 20). Sprint 4 COMPLETE (shipped Apr 20 — 13 days ahead of plan). App live at kidneyhood-automation-architecture.vercel.app with no-auth tokenized flow (`/labs` → `/gate/[token]` → `/results/[token]`). G1/G2/G3 guardrails active. CSP Report-Only live on both frontend + backend (72-hour verification window before enforcing flip).
**Client Dashboard:** https://kidneyhood-automation-architecture.vercel.app/client/lee-a3f8b2 — auto-updated by `scripts/refresh-sprint-progress.py`.

## What's Next

### Sprint 5 — Launch Readiness (DONE — shipped Apr 20, 2026)

Theme A delivered end-to-end in a single day. 9 engineering cards merged + deployed (8 planned + LKID-82 PDF added mid-sprint when Brad pointed at `project/PDF Report.html`). Sprint 4 rollovers (LKID-68 postmortem, LKID-69 dup Postgres) also closed during the sprint.

| Card | Title | Owner | Status | PR |
|------|-------|-------|--------|----|
| LKID-72 | Sentry frontend + backend error monitoring | John + Harshit | **Done** | #55 |
| LKID-71 | PostHog conversion funnel analytics (labs/gate/results/pdf) | Harshit | **Done** | #56 |
| LKID-76 | Results page design parity + sitewide font regression | Harshit + Inga | **Done** | #57 |
| LKID-79 | Extract Results page into ResultsView component | Harshit | **Done** | #58 |
| LKID-80 | Chart redesign — pixel-for-pixel match to project/Results.html (design hues, AA override on chart SVG) | Harshit + Inga | **Done** | #59 |
| LKID-75 | Lee dashboard v2 — launch-metrics panels | Harshit + Inga | **Done** | #60 |
| LKID-82 | PDF report design parity to project/PDF Report.html | Harshit + Inga | **Done** | #62 |
| LKID-74 | CSP + 6 security headers (Report-Only mode) | John + Harshit | **Done** | #63 |
| LKID-73 | SEO basics (OG tags, sitemap, robots, JSON-LD, MedicalWebPage) | Harshit + Inga | **Done** | #64 |

**Sprint 4 rollovers closed during Sprint 5:**

- LKID-68 postmortem — 5 Brad-gated items resolved (AI-1/2/4/5 decisions, AI-3 superseded by LKID-71 shipping). SOP Rules 7 (binding runbooks + delta review) and 8 (G1 fail-closed permanent) added.
- LKID-69 dup Postgres service — verified empty and deleted via Railway GraphQL. Live DB unchanged.
- LKID-78 audit discrepancy — closed as working-as-intended. `sex="unknown"` hardcode at `/labs` form locked in per Lee's preference; decision recorded in three places (form comment, engine docstring, investigation memo).

**Backlog (filed, not scheduled):**

- LKID-77 — Engine edge case: `compute_dial_age` returns None when `trajectory[0] < 12` (Low, agent:john-donaldson)
- LKID-81 — Wire up visual-regression tests (install Playwright, rewrite spec for tokenized flow, add CI job) (Medium, Harshit + Yuri pairing)

**Still Brad-hands (agents can't do these):**

- **PostHog env vars** on Vercel (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` + host) — until set, PostHog is a silent no-op per design
- **Sentry env vars** (5 total) on Vercel + Railway — until set, no error capture in prod
- **Resend DNS + Klaviyo Flow** (LKID-47 Klaviyo dashboard config)
- **Lee email** — Sprint 5 update draft at `agents/husser/drafts/email-to-lee-sprint5-update.md` ready to send
- **CSP enforcing-mode flip** — requires 72-hour clean verification window per LKID-74 post-merge checklist
- **DNS flip to kidneyhood.org** — once live, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://kidneyhood.org` on Vercel (auto-propagates to sitemap/robots/OG/JSON-LD)

### Sprint 4 — No-Auth Tokenized Flow (DONE — shipped Apr 20, 2026)

**Shipped 13 days ahead of plan** in a single autonomous orchestrator run. 18 PRs merged, 7 engineering cards Done, LKID-47 backend code shipped, 3 guardrails added (G1 preDeploy migrations, G2 CI post-deploy smoke, G3 6-hour heartbeat).

**Full retro:** `agents/husser/drafts/sprint4-retrospective.md`.

### Lee's Responses (2026-03-30) — All 6 Questions Answered

Full responses at `agents/luca/drafts/lee-q1-q6-responses.md`. Summary:
- Q1: Use v2.0 formulas — **golden vectors received 2026-04-02** (see `agents/luca/drafts/lee-golden-vectors-v2.md`)
- Q2: CKD-stage rates OK for marketing app
- Q3: Both suppression estimate AND structural floor (BUN > 17)
- Q4: Dialysis threshold = eGFR 12 confirmed
- Q5: Age attenuation — implemented (two lines)
- Q6: Creatinine max 20.0 confirmed
- Bonus: Path 4 post-decline rate → -0.33 (pilot data n=28)

**Still waiting on Lee:** Klaviyo API key (LKID-47). Treatment decline rates for Stages 3a, 3b, 5 (Lee's vectors only cover Stage 4 — uses -2.0/yr vs engine's -3.0/yr for that stage).

### Post-Ship (after April 9 retro)

| # | Task | Owner |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Full document restructure into `docs/governance/`, `docs/technical/`, `docs/clinical/`, `docs/reports/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/reference/` | Husser + Luca |
| 2 | Create Jira card to track restructure (prevents indefinite deferral) | Husser |

See `active/chatroom/chatroom_report.md` for the full decision rationale.

### Done (Sprint 2 Close)

- 11 PRs merged (#9–#21). Jira board swept and aligned.
- 4 HIGH-severity post-merge bugs found and fixed (`agents/yuri/drafts/sprint2-debacle-qa-report.md`).
- 3 Vercel build blockers fixed (Playwright tsconfig, Clerk v7 types, middleware). Clerk middleware disabled temporarily — full migration needed in Sprint 3.
- Client dashboard live and auto-updating for Lee.
- Remediation cards LKID-48–58: 10/11 complete. Only LKID-49 deferred with chart.

## Automated Processes

- **Sprint progress sync:** Scheduled remote agent runs every 6 hours (trigger ID: `trig_017nHqTJu4Y3tTstg3UtTwb1`). Uses Atlassian MCP to pull Jira statuses, updates `sprint-progress.json` in both locations, commits+pushes to trigger Vercel rebuild. Manage at https://claude.ai/code/scheduled/trig_017nHqTJu4Y3tTstg3UtTwb1. Fallback script: `scripts/refresh-sprint-progress.py` (requires `.env` with `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`).
- **Husser board sweep:** Scheduled remote agent runs daily at 8am ET (trigger ID: `trig_01VZxLyxxsNXe8AqswJkev2M`). Checks card-to-PR alignment, stale PRs, blocker detection, QA pipeline readiness. Manage at https://claude.ai/code/scheduled.

## Development Workflow

CTO (Luca) opens one PR per Jira card. Each card gets a feature branch (`feat/LKID-{number}-{description}`). Copilot is added as reviewer on every PR. Agents implement on their branches. PRs merge to `main` when approved.

### PR Review & Merge Cycle

1. Push branch → open PR via `gh pr create`
2. Poll reviews (~60s): `gh api repos/Automation-Architecture/LKID/pulls/{N}/reviews` + `/comments`
3. Both **Copilot** and **CodeRabbit** auto-review — address all actionable findings
4. Dispatch engineer agent to fix review findings on the correct branch
5. Yuri QA pass — verdict must be PASS before merge
6. Merge via `gh pr merge {N} --squash`
7. If next PR has overlap, rebase onto updated main before merging

### Merge Order Protocol (from Sprint 2 postmortem)

- Merge in dependency order: lowest-risk/no-overlap first, highest-risk last
- Rebase between each merge when branches share files
- See `agents/luca/drafts/sprint3-commit-strategy.md` for the template

## Team

| Role | Agent | Jira Label |
|------|-------|------------|
| Orchestrator (CTO) | Luca | `agent:luca` |
| Product Manager | Husser | `agent:husser` |
| UX/UI Designer | Inga | `agent:inga` |
| API Designer | John Donaldson | `agent:john-donaldson` |
| Database Engineer | Gay Mark | `agent:gay-mark` |
| Frontend Developer | Harshit | `agent:harshit` |
| QA / Test Writer | Yuri | `agent:yuri` |

## Known Issues

- **Worktree subagent permissions:** Background subagents cannot get interactive permission approvals. Worktrees created via `git worktree add` don't help — the Bash/Write tools are still denied. Foreground deployment (sequential) works. Only one background agent (Harshit, Sprint 3) got through permissions; root cause unclear.
- **Cross-branch stash conflicts:** Never `git stash pop` when the stash contains files from multiple feature branches. Files that exist on one branch but not another (e.g., `chart/` on LKID-19 but not LKID-5) cause add/delete conflicts. Fix: commit each branch sequentially — never stash mixed cross-branch work.
- **Multi-agent workspace contamination:** When dispatching multiple foreground agents for different branches, each agent's edits land in the same workspace regardless of target branch. The last agent's checkout wins. Fix: dispatch one agent, commit+push its branch, then dispatch the next.

## Critical Rules

- Agents write ONLY in their own `/agents/{name}/` folder
- Agents may read but NOT modify another agent's artifacts
- Approved contracts are binding; QA approval REQUIRED
- **Jira is the source of truth.** When new information comes in (docs, specs, decisions), update the relevant Jira cards immediately. Card descriptions, comments, and statuses must always reflect current state. Don't let agent drafts diverge from Jira.
- All `memory/*.json` must stay in sync with project artifacts (114 entries: 31 patterns, 19 anti-patterns, 16 decisions, 17 insights, 31 tools)
- **Husser is Board Nanny** — daily Jira sweep at 8am ET (see `agents/husser/drafts/product-management-sop.md`)
- **QA SOP is binding** — Yuri follows `docs/qa-testing-sop.md` for all reviews; skill invocation rules in `agents/yuri/notes.md`
- **Merge protocol** — post-merge verification required per `docs/development-phase-engineering-sop.md` (corrective actions from Sprint 2 post-mortem)

## Diagramming

Use Excalidraw MCP (`mcp__claude_ai_Excalidraw__create_view`) for all diagrams. Save `.excalidraw` files alongside related docs. Use Automation Architecture brand palette (defined in global CLAUDE.md).
